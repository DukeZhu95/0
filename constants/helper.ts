The Security of Your Information

We take steps to ensure your information is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to mitigate risks to the security of your data. These measures are designed to account for the varying likelihood and severity of potential risks to your rights and freedoms. We periodically review and update these measures to enhance the overall security of our systems.

The Platform may include links to websites of our partners, advertisers, or affiliates. These external websites have their own privacy policies, and we do not assume responsibility for their practices. Review their policies before submitting any personal information.

How Long We Keep Your Information
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Retention may also occur to meet contractual and legal obligations, legitimate business interests (such as improving Platform functionality, safety, and stability), or for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

Retention periods depend on factors such as the type of information and its intended use. For instance:
Profile Information:
Retained as long as your account is active.
Violation of Policies:
If you breach our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other conditions, your profile and User Content may be removed from public view immediately. However, we may retain other information to address the violation.
