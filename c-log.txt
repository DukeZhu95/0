Looks like fastlane ran into a build/archive error with your project
It's hard to tell what's causing the error, so we wrote some guides on how
to troubleshoot build and signing issues: https://docs.fastlane.tools/codesigning/getting-started/
Before submitting an issue on GitHub, please follow the guide above and make
sure your project is set up correctly.
fastlane uses `xcodebuild` commands to generate your binary, you can see the
the full commands printed out in yellow in the above log.
Make sure to inspect the output above, as usually you'll find more error information there
[!] Error building the application - see the log above
Error: The "Run fastlane" step failed because of an error in the Xcode build process. We automatically detected following errors in your Xcode build logs:
- Multiple commands produce '/Users/expo/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Challenz-dszymaopcrgcjygdellnrubfhhqs/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/Challenz/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/UninstalledProducts/iphoneos/op_sqlite.framework/Headers/libsql.h'
